# privacy-policy

This is the privacy-policy for the Domino game of Flakos Developers
In this game we respect the users data and personal information.
I dont collect any kind of info, data, location, etc.
No user data is stored out of the user device.
The only info that is stored in the user device is the number of games won and this is used only for showing this data at the end of each game.
In my games the privacy of the users is a very important thing.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.
